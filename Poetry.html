There are no crossroads, no roads apart. It’s like we don’t want to go home, we don’t want to rest. I take a breather, and tug at your shirt. It’s because I need you to know that I’m always the best.

You could complete the lyrics. Literally.
You complete the lyrics with how much you show your love to me. 
You take my hands, and show me that life is so sweet with you in it.
You fasten my belt and still take me on a highway,
You take my hands and my whole life too.

Your calls are my reminders, you make the distance work. You make the clock go round, each hour showering me with your gifts. Your virtual hugs, your voice.
